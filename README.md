## **Project Overview 🌍**  
This project is a **social media application** built as part of the **JavaScript 2 Course Assignment**. Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their posts while enjoying additional features like commenting, reacting to posts, and following other users. The app leverages the **Noroff Social Media API** and focuses on functionality and error handling over visual styling. 

The project was collaboratively developed by [**Rikke Juliane Andreassen**](https://github.com/rikkejuliane) and [**Nikolas Bishop**](https://github.com/Niksubishi).
